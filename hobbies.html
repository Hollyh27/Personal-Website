                <h3><u>Reading</u></h3>
        <p>My main hobby is reading. This is what i spent most of my free time doing. I read everyday after college and for a while before bed each night. </p>
            <p>My favourite book series is <i>Throne of Glass</i> by Sarah J. Maas. It is an 8 book fantasy series which follows the journey an 18 year old assassin through a world filled with secrets, magic, and power struggles. Along the way she uncovers the truth about the world and ends in an epic confrontation.</p>

            <p>I really love watching movies and rating them on <a href="http://www.letterboxd.com" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a>. I Think that it is really fun getting to read my friends funny reviews on movies</p>
            <p>My favourite movie of all time is <i>Coraline</i>. It has been my favourite movie since the first time i watched it when i was 7. I think that the style and the music in the movie are extremely impressive, along with the really interesting storyline.</p>
